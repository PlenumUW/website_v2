                        <p class="mb-0 my-2"> [coming soon] In addition to our yearly publication, Plenum also offers feedback on projects and papers that students are working on throughout the school year. Topics don't specifically need to be Geography centered. Students can register for this service for a small fee and will be assigned a skilled peer reviewer. The peer reviewer will check in with the student periodically over the duration of the project to help ensure the project is satisfactory upon submission of the assignment. Students may also use the same assignment as a basis for submitting to the journal for a chance to be featured in our yearly publication.
