                        <p class="mb-0">If your piece is selected, you will meet with your assigned editor regularly over the course of the quarter preceding publication. Plenum publishes high-quality work which contributes to larger conversations within Geography, whether that is addressing a gap in the literature, furthering current scholarship, or taking an innovative approach to existing scholarship. We expect that you are interested in challenging yourself and your work to meet Plenumâ€™s standards of quality, integrity, originality, and critical analytic thought.
